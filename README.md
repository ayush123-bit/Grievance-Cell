# Grievance-Cell

A digital complaint management system built using Node.js, Express, JavaScript, and Handlebars. The platform enables users (e.g., students or employees) to submit grievances securely, and administrators to track, manage, and resolve them efficiently.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Grievance-Cell provides a centralized web-based interface for users to:
- Submit complaints or feedback anonymously or with identity
- Track the status of their submissions
- Receive responses from the admin or resolution team

Admins can:
- View all grievances
- Mark them as resolved
- Send responses to users
- Maintain records with timestamps
